# The-Hub-Portal 

**Mission** 

To build a platform to connect science clubs in Kenyan universities to collaborate, learn and allow easy access to local data

**Vision**

I'm working with science clubs in universities to create a platform that brings together young scientists from different parts of Kenya and gives them tools, resources and mentorship so that they can access local data easily and create solutions that work for our country.
